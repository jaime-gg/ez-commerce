## Walkthrough


## Usage

Youâ€™ll need to use the [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and the [dotenv package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to use environment variables to store sensitive data, like your MySQL username, password, and database name.

Use the `schema.sql` file in the `db` folder to create your database using MySQL shell commands. Use environment variables to store sensitive data, like your MySQL username, password, and database name.
